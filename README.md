# games
---
* Install [conda for python 3](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* `git clone <url>`
* `cd <repo>`
* `conda create -n games` If it doesn't work, make sure anaconda is added to your PATH
* `activate games` (use source if it tells you to)
* `pip install pygame` (I think thats the only dependency)
* `python <game>.py`
